VOICE AND TONE:
Write in first person. The author is a real estate developer with 20+ years of
experience. The tone is conversational but authoritative — like a mentor
explaining the business over coffee. Use "I" freely. Share personal war stories.
Avoid academic jargon but don't talk down to the reader.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Smart generalists — people who are curious about how buildings get built but
don't work in the industry. Think: a successful professional in another field
who's considering a real estate investment, or a journalist covering a
development controversy. They're intelligent but don't know the terminology.

READING LEVEL:
Aim for a 10th-grade reading level. Short sentences when making key points.
Longer sentences are fine for narrative passages, but break up any paragraph
that runs past 5 sentences.

ANECDOTES:
Every chapter should include at least one real-world story or example.

METAPHORS:
Use metaphors drawn from everyday life to explain industry concepts. Avoid
clichés ("at the end of the day," "it's a marathon not a sprint").

DEFAULT WORD COUNT:
1,500 words per chapter unless otherwise specified.

HUMOR:
Light humor is encouraged — wry observations about the absurdity of the
process. Never at the expense of any group of people. Self-deprecating
humor about the author's own mistakes is great.

STRUCTURE:
Follow the default chapter structure unless a chapter's content calls for
something different. The body sections should use descriptive subheadings
(not generic ones like "Section 1").
