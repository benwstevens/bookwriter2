            description: >
              Introduce the reader to the development timeline.
              Cover the gap between public perception and reality.
              Use the metaphor of pregnancy — a building gestates.
              Explain the typical timeline from conception to completion
              and why each phase exists.
            intro: >
              Open with a scene: a person driving past an empty lot,
              then driving past the same lot two years later to find
              a half-finished structure. Set up the core question —
              why does this take so long?

                description: >
                  The 2-4 years of work that happen before a shovel
                  hits the ground.

                description: >
                  The design and pre-construction phase — architects,
                  engineers, and the coordination problem.

            conclusion: >
              Synthesize the timeline into a framework the reader
              can carry forward. Buildings take long because every
              phase depends on the last — it's a chain, not a checklist.
            transition: >
              Now that we understand the timeline, the next chapter
              digs into where it all starts: finding and securing land.

          - title: "Dirt, Dollars, and Due Diligence"
            description: >
              The land acquisition process. Due diligence, environmental
              studies, zoning, entitlements. Why most deals die here.
              Walk through a real-world example of a site evaluation
              and the hidden costs that kill projects before they start.
            intro: >
              Open with a developer standing on an empty lot, imagining
              a building — then discovering the lot sits on a former
              gas station with contaminated soil.

                  - "The timeline cost of entitlement delays"
            conclusion: >
              Due diligence is where most projects die — and that's
              a feature, not a bug. It protects developers from
              expensive mistakes downstream.
            transition: >
              With land secured and entitlements in hand, the next
              question is: who's paying for all this?

      - title: "Financing the Vision"
        description: >
          How development projects are funded, from equity raises
          to construction loans.

          - title: "The Money Stack"
            description: >
              How real estate development is financed. Equity, debt,
              mezzanine financing, construction loans. The capital stack
              explained for non-finance people. Why developers use
              other people's money and what that means for risk.
            intro: >
              Open with the paradox: the developer's name is on the
              building, but it's almost never the developer's money.
              Introduce the capital stack as the financial architecture
              behind every project.

                description: >
                  The lending layer — construction loans, permanent financing.

                  - "What happens when the market shifts mid-raise"
            conclusion: >
              The capital stack is a balancing act — enough leverage
              to amplify returns, not so much that a downturn wipes
              out the project.
            transition: >
              With money in hand, it's time to design and build.
              The next part of the book follows the project from
              blueprints to ribbon-cutting.
