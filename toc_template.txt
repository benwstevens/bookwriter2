I need you to create a detailed table of contents for a non-fiction book, formatted as YAML that my book generator can consume. Output ONLY the YAML — no explanation, no code fences.

Here is the structure and rules:

=== TOP LEVEL ===
title: "Book Title"
author: "Author Name"
default_word_target: 1500          # default words per chapter (can be overridden per chapter)

=== HIERARCHY ===
The book is organized as: parts → sections → chapters

parts:                             # 2-5 parts that represent the book's major movements
  - title: "Part I: ..."          # the part title (readers will see this)
    description: >                 # 1-3 sentences on what this part covers and why it exists
      ...

    sections:                      # 1-3 sections per part that group related chapters
      - title: "Section Title"
        description: >             # 1-2 sentences on this section's focus
          ...

        chapters:                  # 2-4 chapters per section
          - title: "Chapter Title"
            word_target: 3500      # optional — override the default for this chapter
            description: >         # 2-4 sentences: what the chapter argues, what ground it covers
              ...

=== DETAILED CHAPTER STRUCTURE (required for every chapter) ===
Each chapter must include these fields:

            intro: >
              Guidance for the opening 1-3 paragraphs. Use a metaphor from a different field or walk of life and then explain how that it illustrates the central idea or epiphany this chapter will explain. This helps break the flow of a given discipline and brings it back to something anyone can understand.

            chapter_sections:        # 3-4 sections per chapter
              - heading: "Section Subheading"
                description: >
                  A short catchy description of a few words for this section's focus.
                bullet_points:       # 3-5 specific points the section must address
                  - "First point — be concrete, not abstract"
                  - "Second point"
                  - "Third point"

            conclusion: >
              Guidance for the closing 1-2 paragraphs. Is there any big idea that's now clear that they can only understand now that they     know what this chapter covered? Is there any major caveat to all of this that everyone knows. Make those big picture points here. 

            transition: >
              1-2 sentences bridging to the next chapter. The reader may have lost interest by this point. Create tension by explaining how the information from this chapter leads into, or is better understood, in the context of what comes next. For the final chapter,
              replace this with a note about closing the book's arc.

=== RULES ===
1. Every chapter MUST have: title, description, intro, chapter_sections (3-4), conclusion, transition
2. Every chapter_section MUST have: heading, bullet_points (3-5 bullets) to describe what content will go here
3. Bullet points should be CONCRETE — ideas, questions, frameworks, or arguments to make.
4. The intro field should suggest a specific opening device (a scene, a story, a striking fact) — not just "introduce X."
5. Transitions should connect chapters by theme. The last chapter of each part should transition to the next part's themes.
6. Parts should represent genuine shifts in the book's arc (e.g., "understanding the problem" → "building the solution" → "living with the result").
7. Sections within a part should group chapters that share a sub-theme.
8. Use YAML multi-line strings (>) for all description, intro, conclusion, and transition fields.
9. Chapter titles should be vivid and specific — not generic ("Understanding X"). Think magazine-article headlines.

=== BOOK TOPIC ===
Replace everything below this line with your book description. Be as specific
as you want — the more you give, the better the TOC. At minimum, cover:

SUBJECT & ANGLE:
What is this book about? What's the perspective or thesis? Who is the narrator —
an insider, an outsider, a veteran? Example: "A book about developing a
wastewater treatment plant, told from the perspective of someone who's done 10
of these and knows what really happens behind the scenes."

PART-LEVEL STRUCTURE (optional but recommended):
If you have opinions about the major movements of the book, state them. You can
be loose — the AI will refine the breakdown. Example:
- Part 1: history, politics, funding — why these projects happen
- Part 2: the design process — all the consultants and how it works
- Part 3: construction
- Part 4: aftermath and lessons learned

CHAPTER COUNT & LENGTH:
How many chapters? What word count per chapter? Example: "13 chapters,
1200-1400 words each." If unspecified, defaults to the default_word_target above.

SPECIFIC TOPICS OR CHAPTERS (optional):
If there are specific chapters or topics you definitely want included, list them.
Example: "I want a chapter specifically about how funding works — the alphabet
soup of SRF, USDA, WIFIA, and how communities that need the most help have the
least capacity to navigate the process."

ANYTHING ELSE:
Any other constraints, preferences, or ideas. Examples: "Keep it to 4 parts,"
"I want the last chapter to be reflective, not prescriptive," "Include appendices
for glossary and further reading."
