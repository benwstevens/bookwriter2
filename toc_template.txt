I need you to create a detailed table of contents for a non-fiction book, formatted as YAML that my book generator can consume. Output ONLY the YAML — no explanation, no code fences.

Here is the structure and rules:

=== TOP LEVEL ===
title: "Book Title"
author: "Author Name"
default_word_target: 3500          # default words per chapter (can be overridden per chapter)

=== HIERARCHY ===
The book is organized as: parts → sections → chapters

parts:                             # 2-5 parts that represent the book's major movements
  - title: "Part I: ..."          # the part title (readers will see this)
    description: >                 # 1-3 sentences on what this part covers and why it exists
      ...

    sections:                      # 1-3 sections per part that group related chapters
      - title: "Section Title"
        description: >             # 1-2 sentences on this section's focus
          ...

        chapters:                  # 2-4 chapters per section
          - title: "Chapter Title"
            word_target: 3500      # optional — override the default for this chapter
            description: >         # 2-4 sentences: what the chapter argues, what ground it covers
              ...

=== DETAILED CHAPTER STRUCTURE (required for every chapter) ===
Each chapter must include these fields:

            intro: >
              Guidance for the opening 1-3 paragraphs. Suggest a specific
              scene, anecdote, metaphor, or hook — not "introduce the topic."
              Be concrete: who, what, where.

            chapter_sections:        # 3-4 sections per chapter
              - heading: "Section Subheading"
                description: >
                  1-2 sentences on what this section covers and what it argues.
                bullet_points:       # 3-5 specific points the section must address
                  - "First point — be concrete, not abstract"
                  - "Second point"
                  - "Third point"

            conclusion: >
              Guidance for the closing 1-2 paragraphs. What should the reader
              understand now that they didn't before? How does this chapter's
              argument land?

            transition: >
              1-2 sentences bridging to the next chapter. Reference what's
              coming next by theme, not just title. For the final chapter,
              replace this with a note about closing the book's arc.

=== RULES ===
1. Every chapter MUST have: title, description, intro, chapter_sections (3-4), conclusion, transition
2. Every chapter_section MUST have: heading, description, bullet_points (3-5 bullets)
3. Bullet points should be CONCRETE — specific examples, questions, frameworks, or arguments to make. Not vague topic labels.
4. The intro field should suggest a specific opening device (a scene, a story, a striking fact) — not just "introduce X."
5. Transitions should connect chapters by theme. The last chapter of each part should transition to the next part's themes.
6. Parts should represent genuine shifts in the book's arc (e.g., "understanding the problem" → "building the solution" → "living with the result").
7. Sections within a part should group chapters that share a sub-theme.
8. Aim for 8-15 chapters total, distributed across 2-5 parts.
9. Use YAML multi-line strings (>) for all description, intro, conclusion, and transition fields.
10. Chapter titles should be vivid and specific — not generic ("Understanding X"). Think magazine-article headlines.
